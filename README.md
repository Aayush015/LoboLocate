Welcome to **LoboLocate**, a mobile app designed to help users report, find, and match lost and found items. This app is built with **React Native** for the frontend, with a **Node.js/Express** backend hosted on Heroku, and uses **MongoDB** for data storage. LoboLocate connects users to potential matches, facilitates real-time chats, and allows item reporting through the Google Vision API for image processing.
